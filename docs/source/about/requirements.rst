System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FlexChem/KPP requires the following packages:

#. A C-language compiler (such as gcc, from the `GNU Compiler Collection<https://gcc.gnu.org/>`__)
#. The ``flex`` lexical parser library.  This is often installed on
   many computer systems by default.  It can also be easily installed
   with a package manager such as `Spack <https://github.com/spack/spack>`__.

Depending on your setup, you might have to load these packages with the
``module load`` or ``spack load`` commands. Ask your sysadmin
for more information.
