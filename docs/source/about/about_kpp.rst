The `Kinetic PreProcessor
(KPP)<https://people.cs.vt.edu/asandu/Software/Kpp/>`__
translates a chemical mechanism specification (in user-editable
configuration files) to optimized source code that can be included in
atmospheric models.  KPP can create chemical solver source code
Fortran-77, Fortran-90, C, and Matlab.

The most recent public KPP version is 2.2.3_01, which may be
obtained from the KPP web site.

We have created a `Github
repository<https://github.com/geoschem/KPP`__ that contains KPP
version 2.2.3_01 (stored in the ``main`` branch).  Modifications to
KPP for the GEOS-Chem, Mistra, and Messy models are kept in
separate branches so as not to conflict with the base KPP version.
