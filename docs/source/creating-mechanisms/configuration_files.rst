=================================
User-editable configuration files
=================================

In the ``KPP/custom`` folder within the GEOS-Chem source code, you
will find two files that define the chemical mechanism:

----------
custom.eqn
----------

The ``custom.eqn`` configuration file contains:

- List of active species
- List of inactive species
- Gas-phase reactions
- Heterogeneous reactions
- Photolysis reactions

---------
gckpp.kpp
---------
  
The ``gckpp.kpp`` configuration file contains:

- Solver options
- Production and loss family definitions
- Functions to compute reaction rates
- Global definitions
  
.. important:: The ``KPP/fullchem`` folder within the GEOS-Chem source code
	       contains configuration files (``fullchem.eqn``,
	       ``gckpp.kpp``) plus the Fortran-90 modules generated by
	       KPP-for-GEOS-Chem.

	       You should leave these files untouched and only edit
	       the chemical mechanism configuration files in the
	       ``KPP/custom`` folder.   This will allow you to revert
	       to the default "out-of-the-box" fullchem mechanism if
	       the need should arise.
